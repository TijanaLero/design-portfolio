# ⏲️ Pomodoro App (Figma Prototype)

## 📚 Background / Context
The Pomodoro technique helps users stay productive by working in short, focused intervals followed by quick breaks. Many existing apps complicate the process of setting up a Pomodoro routine. This project explores a cleaner and more intuitive way for users to quickly create a Pomodoro schedule tailored to their work needs.

## 👩‍💻 Problem Statement
Users should be able to set up their Pomodoro routine quickly and easily. They need simple controls to:

- Choose focus session duration  
- Set break duration  
- Define the number of cycles  

The goal is to make the setup process smooth and clear, allowing anyone to create a consistent, structured work schedule without navigating confusing menus or technical options.

## 🔬 Scope
This prototype focuses solely on the **setup experience** for creating a recurring Pomodoro schedule. Key priorities in the design:

- **Clarity:** Users understand each option instantly.  
- **Speed:** The routine can be created in just a few taps/clicks.  
- **Simplicity:** Only essential configuration elements are included, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
