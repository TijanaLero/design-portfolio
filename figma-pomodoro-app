📚 Background / Context
The Pomodoro technique helps people stay productive by working in short, focused intervals followed by quick breaks. Many apps make setting this up more complicated than necessary. We want to explore a cleaner, more intuitive way for users to quickly create a Pomodoro routine that matches their work needs.


👩‍💻 Problem Statement
Users should be able to set up their Pomodoro routine quickly and easily. They need simple controls to choose how long they want to focus, how long their breaks should be, and how many cycles they want to complete, without dealing with confusing menus or technical options. The goal is to make the setup process smooth and clear so anyone can create a consistent, structured work schedule.


🔬 Scope
Focus only on the setup experience for creating a recurring Pomodoro schedule

Include the essential elements of Pomodoro configuration:
Focus session duration
Break duration
Number of cycles
Prioritize clarity, speed, and simplicity in the interaction design
